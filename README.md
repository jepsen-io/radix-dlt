# jepsen.radix-dlt

Jepsen tests for the Radix distributed ledger system.

## Installation

In addition to a Jepsen environment, you'll need a RadixDLT client.

```
git clone https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt.git
git checkout release/1.0-beta.40
```

Compile and install each part of the client library. This apparently only builds with JDK 11, so you'll need to downgrade, compile, then flip back.

```
cd radixdlt-engine
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../gradlew install
```

```
cd ../radixdlt-java-common/
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../gradlew install
```

```
cd ../radixdlt-java/radixdlt-java
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../../gradlew install
```
