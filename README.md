# jepsen.radix-dlt

Jepsen tests for the Radix distributed ledger system.

## Installation

In addition to a Jepsen environment, you'll need a RadixDLT client.

```
git clone https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt.git
git checkout release/1.0-beta.40
```

Compile and install each part of the client library. This apparently only builds with JDK 11, so you'll need to downgrade, compile, then flip back.

```
cd radixdlt-engine
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../gradlew install

cd ../radixdlt-java-common/
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../gradlew install

cd ../radixdlt-java/radixdlt-java
echo "apply plugin: 'maven'" >> build.gradle
../../gradlew install
```

To see the exact version this installed, check:

```
ls ~/.m2/repository/com/radixdlt/radixdlt-java/
```

## Usage

```
lein run test-all --concurrency 3n
```

## Building Radix DLT

If you need to build a custom build of Radix to test a patch:

```sh
cd radix
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --output type=local,dest=out --progress plain -f radixdlt-core/docker/Dockerfile.build .
```

This will spit out a zipfile like

```
out/distributions/radixdlt-1.0.0-<branch>-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

Which you can copy to any local path you like, then run

```sh
lein run test ... --zip path/to/radixdlt-1.0.0-whatever-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

## Testing Against Stokenet

To run tests against the public Stokenet, you'll need an address with XRD. Run
`lein run keygen` to construct a new account, and paste the results into
`stokenet.edn`; then fund that account with some XRD. Running tests with
`--stokenet` will use that account instead.

We don't have access to the raw txn APIs, so you'll need to run with

`--fs txn-log,balance`
